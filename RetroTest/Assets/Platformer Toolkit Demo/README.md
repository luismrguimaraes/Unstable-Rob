# Platformer Toolkit - Demo

[Platformer Toolkit](https://gmtk.itch.io/platformer-toolkit) is an interactive video essay, from the creator of Game Maker’s Toolkit.

You’ll get to see, first hand, how platformer characters are designed, as you use the toolkit to change and adjust over 30 variables that drive the hero’s movement. 

Change Kit’s max speed, jump height, squash and stretch, coyote time, and more - and then play through a sample level with your chosen stats.


This demo package provides access to the scripts that power Kit in the Toolkit, a demo scene to test Kit out inside Unity, and the presets from the Toolkit to experiment with different settings (as well as add your own!)


## Installation

1 - Create a new Unity 2020.3.30f1 project using the 2D Core template

2 - Drag the package into Unity

3 - Import the package

4 - Import the additional Unity packages required for functionality


## Usage

Open the demo scene by double-clicking on the scene file located in:

```bash
Assets/Platformer Toolkit/Platformer Toolkit Demo.unity
```

This scene is set up to demonstrate the basic functionality of the Platformer Toolkit for you to play around with. By default, Kit is currently set up to use Celeste preset, but if you made your own preset in the Platformer Toolkit, you can recreate the settings in Unity by going to the preset folder:

```bash
Assets/Platformer Toolkit/Presets
```

You can use the Custom prefab to write your own settings, or make more presets by either duplicating existing objects or right-clicking the folder space and selecting:

```bash
Create/GMTK/Character Movement Preset
```
